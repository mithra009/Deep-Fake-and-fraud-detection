# Deep-Fake-and-fraud-detection
Uses AI to classify audio as spam, fraud, or genuine. Detects deepfake images using a Vision Transformer (ViT). Extracts up to 50 frames from videos with OpenCV and classifies each using a deep learning model. Aggregates results via weighted voting to determine if a video is real or fake.
